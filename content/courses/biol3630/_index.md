## Welcome to BIOL3630!


Here's all the handouts for this course, which I'll gradually add to in the fullness of time. I'll also add a bit of text here, to make sure I haven't broken the whole site as of 7:16am on 20 June 2024.

<div style="clear: both;">
  <div style="float: left; margin-right 4em; height="75%" width="75%"">
    <img src="amro.jpg" alt="A robin">
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>An attempt at floating</h2>
    <p>Here's a paragraph that I hope will lie to the left (I think) of the robin image. Otherwise, things are much the same. All of this should go where the robin image once was.</p>
  </div>
</div>

And now I'll try to link to the assets folder:

{{< figure src="/images/mawa.jpg" caption="A magnolia warbler" >}}

And here it is as a dropdown:

<summary>Example of an effective layout</summary>

{{< figure src="/images/mawa.jpg" caption="A magnolia warbler" >}}

A Magnolia Warbler. Note the rich detail.
