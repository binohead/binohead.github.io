Now let's try a post using Versatil, which might be a good way to check things before going public.

## Does it work?

Yes, this is the key question. That's some text with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: And that's the footnote.

Let's see how it handles images.

And finally, here's a test of the sidenote:

<p>
    One of the most distinctive features of Tufte’s style is his extensive use of sidenotes.
    <label for="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes" class="margin-toggle">
    <span class="sidenote">This is a sidenote.</span>
    Sidenotes are like footnotes, except they don’t force the reader to jump their eye to the bottom of the page, but instead display off to the side in the margin. Perhaps you have noticed their use in this document already. You are very astute.
