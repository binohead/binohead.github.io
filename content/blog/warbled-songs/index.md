There's a bunch of bird songs I have a hard time with. They all sound like Purple Finches to me.

... many of which are edible, more (wild lettuce) or less (hawkweed?? I don't know).

And one of these will be deomonstrated here, if the embed works:

</div>

After which text will follow.

There's another one, Warbling Vireo, which sounds just like that.

And Blue Grosbeak, though much rarer in these parts (and less likely to sing, I think) is pretty close, too:

Orchard Oriole is another trouble maker, though it does have an icterid air about it that can be helpful:

I could point out this and that to distinguish these, but between Purple Finch being such the strongest default and the others so seldom heard, I'm unlikely to get them right. I'd be tempted to move back to the Boston area just to learn these, were it not for route 128.
