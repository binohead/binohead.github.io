Now let's try a post using Versatil, which might be a good way to check things before going public.

## Does it work?

Yes, this is the key question. That's some text with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: And that's the footnote.

Let's see how it handles images.

Here's some other stuff I've found out about Hugo or whatever all this is:

- hover doesn't work
- sidenotes are hard
- footnotes are the way to go, and/or (see this current post)
- curtains, or whatever they call them (see the first page of 3630)

And even better (though I doubt the link will work):

<a href="#" onclick="alert('Most sources will diagree with this characterization. For further details, go to <a href="https://binohead.github.io/courses/biol3630/">this link</a>, which you should have read by now.')">But with important caveats.</a>
