The internet went wonky at home, and I had all sorts of stuff bookmarked as I tried to fix it.  I wanted to clear the bookmarks, but retain them in case things went pear-shaped again, then realized I could write a blog post that preserved them.

## Yes, you too can internet!

I forget how to do links in markdown, but looking it up it seems like it's:

\ [Link text](https://website-name.com).

So I'll try that. Spoiler alert: the thing that finally worked was removing the iPhone from network options, a bold act that is [reversible](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3793224?sortBy=rank).

Before, we thought the trouble was with Teams, and you can find plenty of links if you google that. But the only one worth saving for us is [how to clear the Teams cache](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/troubleshoot/teams-administration/clear-teams-cache).

OK, now I think I can delete those bookmarks.
