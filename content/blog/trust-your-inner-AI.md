When I read old posts of mine, I'm amazed at what sometimes comes out. Just as amazed as how easily words come when I write without a particular chore of writing at hand, like in a diary, or many of my plant and birding posts.

Joyce Carol Oates, or was it Susan Sontag, or Phyllis Diller, said something like they write to find out what they think. Indeed, ( have total no clue how words stream from my brain. It just runs itself, as we do in everyday conversation, if you let it.

And here's where I get to the punchline: that this process is much like what goes on with AI. A vast bundle or stuff, a buzzing and blooming confusion, is jumbled about and blurted out for better or worse - but mostly for better, because the structure of its blurting reflects the structure of the world that went into it and how.

So, while everyone distrusts the products of AI, at the same time, perhaps they should trust the output of this inner AI a bit more. I know I should; otherwise, I and many like me are paralyzed by the overwhelming range of choice and uncertainty over where true patterns lie.

Well, that was a bit heady, eh. What my brother once referred to as my "mystical prose" will need not a little editing before this site goes public.
