Here's the central question

## Does it work?

Yes, this is the key question. That's some text with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: And that's the footnote.

Let's see how Versatil handles images. It works OK as long as you have the correct (absolute) path:

Sidenotes are hard, so I gave up on them. For onclick text:

<a href="#" onclick="alert('Most sources will disagree with this characterization.')"> But with important caveats.</a>

And here it is with mouseover:

<a href="#" onmouseover="alert('Most sources will disagree with this characterization.')"> But with important caveats.</a>

Or hover?

This is a [hover text](## "The actual causes of the decline are unknown. This is one of the many, many aspects of psychoornithological frequency saturation currently being explored in our laboratory.") example.

There's also the sort of curtain you can pull down, best for intermediate (c. one paragraph) text or images (though I might have to fix the path):
